# CodeIT-EcoGuard

I am exploring the Sustainable AI & Green Tech track, specifically focusing on Air Quality & Local Policy Insights. My project, Code.IT EcoGuard, utilizes a Python-driven predictive model to correlate real-time AQI data with actionable campus policy recommendations. By integrating Secure Data Verification protocols, I aim to ensure the integrity of environmental data used for decision-making, providing a reliable bridge between AI insights and sustainable campus behaviors.
